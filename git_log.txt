    Product has the inventory-filter feature too..
    In Products : When you click  on a Product from products list..you see the inventories done under that product.
    What I did :
    I destroyed the product_seller_mapping link from product list page and kept the inventory linking-link in place of that.
    Now I will need to do some more linking in order to show mapping. Lets see.
